## MIDI Input

Connect a USB or Bluetooth MIDI controller and click **Enable MIDI** in the app header to let your browser stream note data into See Scales. When Web MIDI is available (Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers), the app will listen to every connected input and reuse the built-in audio samples so you hear the same timbres as when you click the on-screen keyboard.

If your browser does not expose the Web MIDI API, the button will be disabled and a short status message will explain the limitation. You can still interact with the visual keyboard and mouse controls.
